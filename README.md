# Guitar-Tuner
Strings on a guitar are very fine tuned, where thickness of the string and its tension are both in play to create a single note. To create even more notes, frets are pressed which allow for the creation of infinite melodies and chords. Both the constant pressure from the player on the strings and the strings natural tendency to untension cause a guitar to fall out of tune, throwing off any intended note meant to be played. Therefore, this automatic guitar tuner is a tool in order to easily fix this issue, eliminating the need for a fine tuned ear. Every sound has a frequency, of course including notes played by plucking guitar strings. These specific notes  (E, A, D, G, B, E4) have defined frequencies and can be probed for in order to give a readout to players.
