#### Project Mission
For this project, we will be using a raspberry pi to create the functionality of a guitar tuner. A microphone will have input read directly to the PI, which will analyze sound for frequencies. These frequencies will be compared to stored data values and a 7-segment display will show the closest note being played, along with LEDs signaling whether the note is slightly too flat or sharp.
